# Martingale Level Fix & tonami_demo Debug Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Martingale Level Starting Point**

**Problem**: System was starting at Level 0 instead of Level 1
**Fix**: Changed all level calculations to start at Level 1

### Changes Made:

#### In `enhanced_martingale.py`:

```python
# MartingaleLane constructor
current_level: int = 1  # Was 0, now 1

# Level calculation in get_next_trade_amount()
return self.base_amount * (self.multiplier ** (self.current_level - 1))  # Was current_level

# Lane assignment calculation
next_amount = lane['base_amount'] * (lane['multiplier'] ** (lane['current_level'] - 1))  # Fixed
```

#### In `database_manager.py`:

```python
# Schema default
current_level INTEGER DEFAULT 1  # Was 0, now 1

# Lane creation
params = (..., 1, ...)  # Explicitly set to 1

# Level progression calculation
next_amount = float(base_amount) * (float(multiplier) ** (next_level - 1))  # Fixed formula
```

### 2. **Enhanced Debug Logging for tonami_demo Issue**

Added comprehensive logging to track:

- Lane update attempts
- Database operations
- Lane state before/after updates
- Error details with full tracebacks

## Expected Martingale Progression (Fixed)

| Step                  | Level | Calculation                     | Amount (1.5x multiplier) |
| --------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Failed trade recorded | 1     | base × 1.5^(1-1) = base × 1.5^0 | $1.00                    |
| Next assignment       | 2     | base × 1.5^(2-1) = base × 1.5^1 | $1.50                    |
| If fails again        | 3     | base × 1.5^(3-1) = base × 1.5^2 | $2.25                    |
| If fails again        | 4     | base × 1.5^(4-1) = base × 1.5^3 | $3.38                    |

## Debug Logging Added for tonami_demo

### In Enhanced Martingale:

```
[DEBUG]: [EnhancedMartingale] [tonami_demo] Attempting to update lane lane_123 with trade abc-456 (Amount: $1.50)
[INFO]: [EnhancedMartingale] [tonami_demo] Successfully updated lane lane_123 with trade abc-456
```

### In Database Manager:

```
[DEBUG]: Updating lane lane_123 with trade abc-456, amount $1.50
[DEBUG]: Lane lane_123 current state: Level 1, Invested $1.00, Trades: 1
[DEBUG]: Lane lane_123 updating to: Level 2, Amount $1.50, Invested $2.50
[INFO]: Successfully updated Martingale lane lane_123 with trade abc-456 - Level 1→2, Amount $1.50
```

## What to Look For in Logs

### For pelly_demo (should work normally):

```
[DEBUG]: [EnhancedMartingale] [pelly_demo] Assigned to existing lane pelly_demo_SYMBOL_123: $1.50 (Level 2)
[INFO]: [EnhancedMartingale] [pelly_demo] Successfully updated lane pelly_demo_SYMBOL_123 with trade abc-123
```

### For tonami_demo (watch for issues):

```
# GOOD - Should see these:
[DEBUG]: [EnhancedMartingale] [tonami_demo] Assigned to existing lane tonami_demo_SYMBOL_456: $1.50 (Level 2)
[INFO]: [EnhancedMartingale] [tonami_demo] Successfully updated lane tonami_demo_SYMBOL_456 with trade def-456

# BAD - If you see these:
[ERROR]: [EnhancedMartingale] [tonami_demo] Failed to update lane tonami_demo_SYMBOL_456 with trade def-456
[ERROR]: Failed to update Martingale lane tonami_demo_SYMBOL_456: [error details]
```

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Restart the bot** to apply all fixes
2. **Monitor logs closely** for both accounts
3. **Look for tonami_demo specific errors** in the debug logs
4. **Check database** - verify lanes are being updated for tonami_demo
5. **Compare behavior** - pelly_demo vs tonami_demo should be identical

## Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **Database permissions** - Does tonami_demo worker have DB write access?
2. **Lane ID conflicts** - Are lane IDs being generated correctly for tonami_demo?
3. **Transaction issues** - Are database updates being committed for tonami_demo?
4. **Race conditions** - Are updates happening too quickly for tonami_demo?

The enhanced debug logging will reveal exactly where the tonami_demo update process is failing.
