# Enhanced Martingale Multi-Account Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Trade Registration Bug in TradeManager

**Problem**: TradeManager was directly accessing `enhanced_manager.pending_trade_results[trade_id]` instead of using the proper method.

**Fix**: Changed to use `enhanced_manager.handle_trade_placed()` method which properly:

- Registers the trade in pending results
- Updates the database lane state
- Invalidates cache for consistency

### 2. Enhanced Debug Logging

**Added**: Comprehensive debug logging to track:

- Which trades are being registered
- Which trades are being looked up for results
- Current pending trades list
- Trade ID mismatches

## Key Changes Made

### In `trade_manager.py`:

```python
# OLD (BUGGY):
enhanced_manager.pending_trade_results[real_trade_id] = {...}

# NEW (FIXED):
enhanced_manager.handle_trade_placed(
    trade_id=real_trade_id,
    account_name=account_name,
    symbol=pair,
    amount=trade_amount,
    lane_id=lane_id,
    expected_payout=0.0
)
```

### In `enhanced_martingale.py`:

- Added detailed debug logging in `handle_trade_placed()`
- Added detailed debug logging in `handle_trade_result()`
- Both methods now show which trades are being tracked

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Both accounts should work properly** with Enhanced Martingale
2. **No more "Trade not found in pending results"** warnings
3. **Proper Martingale progression** for both accounts:
   - pelly_demo: should continue progressing through lanes correctly
   - tonami_demo: should now also progress instead of getting stuck

## What You Should See in Logs

### Good Signs:

```
[DEBUG]: [EnhancedMartingale] Registering trade abc-123 for pelly_demo (Symbol: EURUSD_otc, Amount: $1.5, Lane: lane_123)
[DEBUG]: [EnhancedMartingale] Now tracking 2 pending trades: ['abc-123', 'def-456']
[DEBUG]: [EnhancedMartingale] Handling trade result for abc-123: win (P&L: $1.38)
[INFO]: [EnhancedMartingale] [pelly_demo] Trade abc-123 result: win, P&L: $1.38
```

### Bad Signs (should be gone now):

```
[WARNING]: [EnhancedMartingale] Trade abc-123 not found in pending results
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Restart your bot** to apply the fixes
2. **Monitor logs** for the new debug messages
3. **Watch both accounts** - they should both progress through Martingale properly
4. **Look for the "Trade not found" warnings** - they should be gone
5. **Verify Martingale progression** - both accounts should follow: $1.00 → $1.50 → $2.25 → etc.

## Lane Assignment Strategy (Unchanged)

- **round_robin**: Assigns to lane with fewest trades (across all symbols)
- **fifo**: Assigns to oldest lane first (across all symbols)
- **symbol_priority**: Prioritizes lanes matching the symbol, falls back to others

This allows flexible lane reuse across different trading pairs as you wanted.

## Quick Test

Send a few test signals and monitor that:

1. Both accounts get trades assigned
2. Enhanced Martingale registers both trades
3. When trades complete, Enhanced Martingale finds them in pending results
4. Martingale progression continues for both accounts
